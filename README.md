AI Surveillance System (HTML-Based)

AI Surveillance System is a web-based project designed to demonstrate the concept of intelligent surveillance using artificial intelligence principles. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and focuses on creating a simple, interactive front-end interface for monitoring and surveillance purposes.

🔍 Project Overview

The system simulates an AI-powered surveillance environment where users can view live or recorded footage, understand how AI surveillance works, and visualize features such as motion detection, object monitoring, and alert generation (concept-based or demo-level).

🚀 Features

Clean and responsive user interface

Surveillance dashboard layout

Camera feed / video display section

Alert and status indicators (UI-based)

Easy-to-understand structure for hackathon presentation

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML – Structure of the web pages

CSS – Styling and responsive design

JavaScript – Basic interactivity and logic

🎯 Purpose

This project is created for hackathon demonstration and learning purposes, showcasing how AI surveillance systems can be represented and managed through a web interface. It is suitable for beginners and students exploring AI + Web Development concepts.

📌 Future Enhancements

Integration with real AI models (OpenCV / TensorFlow)

Real-time motion detection

Face recognition

Backend integration
